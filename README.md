# 03 Password Generator

The password generator app allows a user to obtain a password with randomly chosen
characters based on the following parameters:

- password must be between 8 - 128 characters long
- user can select if they want special characters, uppercase & lowercase letters, and numbers in their randomly concocted password

As a reference point for the characters, I used the 'charset' from the net-comber site, here: http://net-comber.com/charset.html.

This project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  Here is a link to the deployed app: https://roccolosito.github.io/password-generator/.
